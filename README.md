# ODBCAdapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/localytics/odbc_adapter.svg?token=kQUiABmGkzyHdJdMnCnv&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/localytics/odbc_adapter)

An ActiveRecord ODBC adapter. Master branch is working off of edge Rails. Previous work has been done to make it compatible with Rails 3.2 and 4.2; for those versions use the 3.2.x or 4.2.x gem releases.

This adapter will work for basic queries for most DBMSs out of the box, without support for migrations. Full support is built-in for MySQL 5 and PostgreSQL 9 databases. You can register your own adapter to get more support for your DBMS using the `ODBCAdapter.register` function.

A lot of this work is based on [OpenLink's ActiveRecord adapter](http://odbc-rails.rubyforge.org/) which works for earlier versions of Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'odbc_adapter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install odbc_adapter

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
